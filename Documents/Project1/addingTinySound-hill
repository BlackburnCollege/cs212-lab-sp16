Add TinySound to your Project

Download the zip file from http://finnkuusisto.github.io/TinySound/releases/
Get the latest release: 1.1.1
Unzip the file into a folder somewhere
Right-click the project you want to add the Jar to and go to "properties"
From there, select "libraries" and click on the "add jar/folder" button
Then chose "tinysound-1.1.1"
You can now use the import : import kuusisto.tinysound.*;
First initalize TinySound by calling TinySound.init()
Now you should be able to create a Music object, passing in a wav file
Call play on your music object and then nothing will happen because TinySound doesn't work.
Hurray.
