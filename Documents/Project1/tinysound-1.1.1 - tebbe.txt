TinySound is probably the best because it can read both wav and ogg files

with the same code


however, for it to read ogg files you have to include the jorbis, vorbisspi, and

tritonus_share libraries with your other libraries

you won't need to import them, but it can't read ogg files without them


for this you need to import the library's tinysound package and Java's File class


Create a new File object, passing the filepath as an argument for the constructor

next call the TinySound static method init

now make a new object of Music, pass in your File object as an argument for the

TinySound static method loadMusic

now call the method play on your Music object, passing it a boolean as an argument

this boolean tells it whether or not to loop


for it to play you need to pause the program somehow while it plays, you could do

this with the using the loop method from thread, but personally, I used the Music

object's playing method, which returns a boolean true if the song is playing, 

inside a while loop so it would play only as long as it needed to.
