This one can be a bit difficult as many parts require an exception catch to work

you'll need to import this library's player package and java's io package


first you'll need to make a new File object, FileInputStream object, and Player object

obviously for the File you give it the file path when you initialize it

then you pass the File as an argument when you initialize the File input stream

next pass the FileInputStream as an argument when you initialize the Player

Player and FileInputStream need to be placed in a try-catch block to work


Finally you just call the play method for player, which also needs to be in a try-catch block
