Adding JFlac

Download the zip file from: https://sourceforge.net/projects/jflac/?source=typ_redirect
Unzip it!
Just do it.
Right-click the project you want to add the Jar to and go to "properties"
From there, select "libraries" and click on the "add jar/folder" button
Then chose from your unzipped file, inside the dist folder: "jflac-1.3"

You can now import the files to use in your code!
Use the import: import org.kc7bfi.jflac.apps.*;
Now you will want to create a Player object, passing in no parameter
On that Player object you should call the decode method and pass in your flac file
Bam! You can now listen to some flac files!
