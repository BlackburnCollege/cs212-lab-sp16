TINYSOUND
I found the TinySound library at https://github.com/finnkuusisto/TinySound
This library can play wav files and ogg files.
It is relatively easy to use and doesn't take that much coding.
All you need to do is download the jar files and add them to your package.
To play ogg files you need to add the jar files that are found in the lib
folder.

PLAYWAV
I found how to write the playwav method from a youtube video:

I don't think that this is very easy to use because each time you want to play
a wav file a screen pops up and you have to find the file in your computer.

JLAYER
I found this at: http://www.javazoom.net/javalayer/sources.html
It plays mp3 files is pretty easy to use and this youtube video is helpful for 
setting it up: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-7cgX_I220
